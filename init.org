This is my Emacs configuration file.

This file is written in [[https://leanpub.com/lit-config][literate programming style]] using [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]. See [[https://github.com/zzamboni/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.el][init.el]] for the generated file.

* References

Emacs config is an art, and I have learned a lot by reading through other people's config files, and from many other resources. These are some of the best ones (several are also written in org mode). You will find snippets from all of these (and possibly others) throughout my config.

* Performance optimization

Lately I've been playing with optimizing my Emacs load time. I have found a couple of useful resources, including:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3kqt6e/2_easy_little_known_steps_to_speed_up_emacs_start/][Two easy little known steps to speed up Emacs start up time]]
- [[https://blog.d46.us/advanced-emacs-startup/][Advanced Techniques for Reducing Emacs Startup Time]]

Based on these, I have added the code below.

First, we wrap the whole init file in a block that sets =file-name-handler-alist= to =nil= to prevent any special-filename parsing of files loaded from the init file (e.g. remote files loaded through tramp, etc.). The =let= block gets closed in the [[Epilogue][Epilogue]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (let ((file-name-handler-alist nil))
#+end_src

Next, a hook that reports how long and how many garbage collections the startup took. We use a hook to run it at the very end, so the message doesn't get clobbered by other messages during startup.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
            (lambda ()
              (message "Emacs ready in %s with %d garbage collections."
                       (format "%.2f seconds"
                               (float-time
                                (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time)))
                       gcs-done)))
#+end_src

Optionally enable =debug-on-error= - I do this only when I'm trying to figure out some problem in my config.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;  (setq debug-on-error t)
#+end_src

If the =gcmh= package is already installed, load and enable it early. If not, this gets installed a bit later in the Package Management section. This package manages the garbage collection thresholds and scheduling to improve performance. DISABLED for now because it seems to cause performance degradation when inserting text in long files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; (when (require 'gcmh nil t)
  ;;   (gcmh-mode 1))
#+end_src

We set =gc-cons-threshold= to its maximum value, to prevent any garbage collection from happening during load time. We also reset this value in the [[Epilogue][Epilogue]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)
#+end_src

* Customized variables

Emacs has its own [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization][Customization mechanism]] for easily customizing many parameters. To make it easier to manage, I keep the customized variables and faces in a separate file and load it from the main file. A lot of my custom settings are configured from this init file as well, but there are always some which I change by hand for added flexibility.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
  (load custom-file)
#+end_src

My current =custom.el= file can be  found  at https://github.com/zzamboni/dot-emacs/blob/master/custom.el.
* Package management

I use the [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/spotlight-use-package-a-declarative-configuration-tool][wonderful use-package]] to manage most of the packages in my installation (one exception is =org-mode=, see below). As this is not bundled yet with Emacs, the first thing we do is install it by hand. All other packages are then declaratively installed and configured with =use-package=. This makes it possible to fully bootstrap Emacs using only this config file, everything else is downloaded, installed and configured automatically.

First, we declare the package repositories to use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables '(package-archives
                          '(("marmalade" . "https://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")
                            ("melpa"     . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                            ("elpa"      . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))))
#+end_src

Then we initialize the package system, refresh the list of packages and install =use-package= if needed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (package-initialize)

  (when (not package-archive-contents)
    (package-refresh-contents))

  (when (not (package-installed-p 'use-package))
    (package-install 'use-package))
#+end_src

Finally, we load =use-package=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'use-package)
#+end_src

We set some configuration for =use-package=:

- The =use-package-always-ensure= variable indicates that =use-package= should always try to install missing packages. For some libraries this is not appropriate, and in those cases you see the =:ensure nil= declaration as part of the =use-package= statement. This applies mainly to libraries which are installed as part of some other package (happens mostly with some libraries that come with org-mode).

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (custom-set-variables '(use-package-always-ensure t))
  #+end_src

- The =use-package-always-defer= sets =:defer true= as the default for all package declarations. This makes Emacs startup much faster by preventing packages from being loaded when Emacs starts, and only doing so when they are needed. Some packages don't work well with this, so you'll see some declarations when I explicitly set =:defer nil= to force the package to be loaded at startup, or =:defer n= to load the package, but only =n= seconds after startup.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (custom-set-variables '(use-package-always-defer t))
  #+end_src

- The =use-package-verbose= variable enables verbose loading of packages, useful for debugging. I set/unset this according to need.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (custom-set-variables '(use-package-verbose nil))
  #+end_src

Testing [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa][=quelpa=]] and to install packages directly from their github repositories (and other places). I install =quelpa= using =use-package= first, and then install [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa-use-package][=quelpa-use-package=]] to allow using =quelpa= from  within =use-package= declarations. Very recursive.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package quelpa
    :defer nil
    :config
    (quelpa
     '(quelpa-use-package
       :fetcher git
       :url "https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package.git"))
    (require 'quelpa-use-package))
  (require 'quelpa)
  (quelpa-use-package-activate-advice)
#+end_src

This variable tells Emacs to prefer the =.el= file if it's newer, even if there is a corresponding =.elc= file. Also, use =auto-compile= to autocompile files as needed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables '(load-prefer-newer t))
  (use-package auto-compile
    :defer nil
    :config (auto-compile-on-load-mode))
#+end_src

Set the load path to the directories from where I sometimes load things outside the package system. Note that the path for specific packages like =org-mode= (which I load from a checkout of its git repository) is set as part of their =use-package= declarations, so they don't appear here.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
#+end_src

Giving a try to [[https://github.com/Malabarba/paradox][Paradox]] for an enhanced package management interface. We set =paradox-github-token= to =t= to disable GitHub integration (I don't want to star  repos).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package paradox
    :defer nil
    :custom
    (paradox-github-token t)
    :config
    (paradox-enable))
#+end_src

* Password management

Password management using =auth-sources= and =pass= (I normally use 1Password, but I have not found a good command-line/Emacs interface for it, so I am using =pass= for now for some items I need to add to my Emacs config file).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'auth-source)
  (require 'auth-source-pass)
  (auth-source-pass-enable)
#+end_src

* Miscellaneous settings
** General settings

Prevent asking for confirmation to kill processes when exiting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables '(confirm-kill-processes nil))
#+end_src

** Proxy settings

These are two short functions I wrote to be able to set/unset proxy settings within Emacs. I haven't bothered to improve or automate this, as I pretty much only need it to be able to install packages sometimes when I'm at work. For now I just call them manually with =M-x zz/(un)set-proxy= when I need to.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun zz/set-proxy ()
    (interactive)
    (customize-set-variable 'url-proxy-services
                            '(("http"  . "proxy.corproot.net:8079")
                              ("https" . "proxy.corproot.net:8079"))))
  (defun zz/unset-proxy ()
    (interactive)
    (customize-set-variable 'url-proxy-services nil))
#+end_src


- Set default encoding.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (set-language-environment "UTF-8")
    (prefer-coding-system       'utf-8)
    (set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8)
    (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
    (setq default-buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8)
  #+end_src

- Load the =cl= library to enable some additional macros (e.g. =lexical-let=).

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'cl)
  #+end_src

- Install and load the =async= package to enable asynchronous operations (this gets loaded by some other packages, but I use it explicitly in =zz/org-babel-async-tangle= below, so I load it explicitly).

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package async)
  #+end_src

- Start the Emacs server

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (server-start)
  #+end_src

- This is probably one of my oldest settings - I remember adding it around 1993 when I started learning Emacs, and it has been in my config ever since. When =time-stamp= is run before every save, the string =Time-stamp: <>= in the first 8 lines of the file will be updated with the current timestamp.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'time-stamp)
  #+end_src

- When at the beginning of the line, make =Ctrl-K= remove the whole line, instead of just emptying it.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (custom-set-variables '(kill-whole-line t))
  #+end_src

- Paste text where the cursor is, not where the mouse is.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (custom-set-variables '(mouse-yank-at-point t))
  #+end_src

- Make completion case-insensitive.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq completion-ignore-case t)
    (custom-set-variables
     '(read-buffer-completion-ignore-case t)
     '(read-file-name-completion-ignore-case t))
  #+end_src

- Show line numbers. I used =linum-mode= before, but it caused severe performance issues on large files. Emacs 26 introduces =display-line-numbers-mode=, which has no perceivable performance impact even on very large files. Disabled for now.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
    (when (>= emacs-major-version 26)
      (use-package display-line-numbers
        :defer nil
        :ensure nil
        :config
        (global-display-line-numbers-mode)))
  #+end_src

- Highlight trailing whitespace in red, so it's easily visible (disabled  for now as it created a lot of noise in some modes, e.g. the org-mode export screen)

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (custom-set-variables '(show-trailing-whitespace nil))
  #+end_src

- Highlight matching parenthesis

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (show-paren-mode)
  #+end_src

- Don't use hard tabs

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (custom-set-variables '(indent-tabs-mode nil))
  #+end_src

- Emacs automatically creates backup files, by default in the same folder as the original file, which often leaves backup files behind. This tells Emacs to [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Backup-Files.html][put all backups in ~/.emacs.d/backups]].

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (custom-set-variables
     '(backup-directory-alist
       `(("." . ,(concat user-emacs-directory "backups")))))
  #+end_src

- [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/WinnerMode][WinnerMode]] makes it possible to cycle and undo window configuration changes (i.e. arrangement of panels, etc.)

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (when (fboundp 'winner-mode) (winner-mode))
  #+end_src

- Add "unfill" commands to parallel the "fill" ones, bind ~A-q~ to =unfill-paragraph= and rebind ~M-q~ to the =unfill-toggle= command, which fills/unfills paragraphs alternatively.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package unfill
      :bind
      ("M-q" . unfill-toggle)
      ("A-q" . unfill-paragraph))
  #+end_src

- Save the place of the cursor in each file, and restore it upon opening it again.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package saveplace
      :defer nil
      :config
      (save-place-mode))
  #+end_src

- Provide mode-specific "bookmarks" - press =M-i= and you will be presented with a list of elements to which you can navigate - they can be headers in org-mode, function names in emacs-lisp, etc.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package imenu-anywhere
      :bind
      ("M-i" . helm-imenu-anywhere))
  #+end_src

- Smooth scrolling (line by line) instead of jumping by half-screens.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package smooth-scrolling
      :config
      (smooth-scrolling-mode 1))
  #+end_src

- Delete trailing whitespace before saving a file.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
  #+end_src

- Suppress "ad-handle-definition: .. redefined" warnings during Emacs startup.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (custom-set-variables '(ad-redefinition-action (quote accept)))
  #+end_src

* System-specific configuration

Some settings maybe OS-specific, and this is where we set them. For now I only use Emacs on my Mac, so only the Mac section is filled out, but there are sections for Linux and Windows as well.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
  (cond ((eq system-type 'darwin)
         <<Mac settings>>
         )
        ((eq system-type 'windows-nt)
         <<Windows settings>>
         )
        ((eq system-type 'gnu/linux)
         <<Linux settings>>
         ))
#+end_src

** Mac
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no :noweb-ref Mac settings
:END:

First, we set the key modifiers correctly to my preferences: Make Command (⌘) act as Meta, Option as Alt, right-Option as Super

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref Mac settings
  (custom-set-variables
   '(mac-command-modifier 'meta)
   '(mac-option-modifier 'alt)
   '(mac-right-option-modifier 'super))
#+end_src

We also make it possible to use the familiar ~⌘-+~ and ~⌘--~ to increase and decrease the font size. ~⌘-=~ is also bound to "increase" because it's on the same key in an English keyboard.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref Mac settings
  (bind-key "M-+" 'text-scale-increase)
  (bind-key "M-=" 'text-scale-increase)
  (bind-key "M--" 'text-scale-decrease)
#+end_src

Somewhat surprisingly, there seems to be no "reset" function, so I define my own and bind it to =⌘-0=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref Mac settings
  (defun zz/text-scale-reset ()
    (interactive)
    (text-scale-set 0))
  (bind-key "M-0" 'zz/text-scale-reset)
#+end_src

We also use the =exec-path-from-shell= to make sure the path settings from the shell are loaded into Emacs (usually it starts up with the default system-wide path).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref Mac settings
  (use-package exec-path-from-shell
    :defer nil
    :config
    (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
#+end_src

I enable =mac-auto-operator-composition-mode= to get ligatures. Note that this requires [[https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport][emacs-mac]] to be installed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref Mac settings
  (if (fboundp 'mac-auto-operator-composition-mode)
      (mac-auto-operator-composition-mode))
#+end_src

The [[https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport][emacs-mac]] port I use binds ~C-M-SPC~ to the Mac "insert symbol" dialog, so I map ~A-M-SPC~ and ~M-s-SPC~ (which is generated by my external keyboard) to =mark-sexp= to select parenthesized expressions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref Mac settings
  (bind-key "A-M-SPC" #'mark-sexp)
  (bind-key "M-s-SPC" #'mark-sexp)
#+end_src
** Linux
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no :noweb-ref Linux settings
:END:

There are no Linux-specific settings for now.

** Windows
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no :noweb-ref Windows settings
:END:

There are no Windows-specific settings for now.

* Keybindings

The [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] package makes Emacs functionality much easier to discover and explore: in short, after you start the input of a command and stop, pondering what key must follow, it will automatically open a non-intrusive buffer at the bottom of the screen offering you suggestions for completing the command. Extremely useful.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package which-key
      :defer nil
      :diminish which-key-mode
      :config
      (which-key-mode))
  #+end_src

I use the =bind-key= package to more easily keep track and manage user keybindings. =bind-key= comes with =use-package= so we just load it.

The main advantage of using this over =define-key= or =global-set-key= is that you can use ~M-x~ =describe-personal-keybindings= to see a list of all the customized keybindings you have defined.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'bind-key)
#+end_src

** Miscellaneous keybindings

- =M-g= interactively asks for a line number and jump to it (=goto-line)=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (bind-key "M-g" 'goto-line)
  #+end_src

- =M-`= focuses the next frame, if multiple ones are active (emulate the Mac "next app window" keybinding)

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (bind-key "M-`" 'other-frame)
  #+end_src

- Interactive search key bindings -  [[https://github.com/benma/visual-regexp-steroids.el][visual-regexp-steroids]] provides sane regular expressions and visual incremental search. We make ~C-s~ and ~C-r~ run the visual-regexp functions. We leave ~C-M-s~ and ~C-M-r~ to run the default =isearch-forward/backward= functions, as a fallback. I use the =pcre2el= package to support PCRE-style regular expressions.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package pcre2el)
    (use-package visual-regexp-steroids
      :custom
      (vr/engine 'pcre2el "Use PCRE regular expressions")
      :bind
      ("C-c r" . vr/replace)
      ("C-c q" . vr/query-replace)
      ("C-r"   . vr/isearch-backward)
      ("C-S-s" . vr/isearch-forward)
      ("C-M-s" . isearch-forward)
      ("C-M-r" . isearch-backward))
  #+end_src

- Key binding to use "[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HippieExpand][hippie expand]]" for text autocompletion

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (bind-key "M-/" 'hippie-expand)
  #+end_src

** Emulating vi's =%= key

One of the few things I missed in Emacs from vi was the =%= key, which jumps to the parenthesis, bracket or brace which matches the one below the cursor. This function implements the functionality. Inspired by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NavigatingParentheses]], but modified to use =smartparens= instead of the default commands, and to work on brackets and braces.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun zz/goto-match-paren (arg)
    "Go to the matching paren/bracket, otherwise (or if ARG is not
    nil) insert %.  vi style of % jumping to matching brace."

* Org mode

I have started using [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] to writing, blogging, coding, presentations and more, thanks to the hearty recommendations and information from [[http://www.cmdln.org/][Nick]] and many others. I am duly impressed. I have been a fan of the idea of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] for many years, and I have tried other tools before (most notably [[https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/][noweb]], which I used during grad school for many of my homeworks and projects), but org-mode is the first tool I have encountered which seems to make it practical. Here are some of the resources I have found useful in learning it:

- Howard Abrams' [[http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-programming-tutorial.html][Introduction to Literate Programming]], which got me jumpstarted into writing code documented with org-mode.
- Nick Anderson's [[https://github.com/nickanderson/Level-up-your-notes-with-Org][Level up your notes with Org]], which contains many useful tips and configuration tricks.
- Sacha Chua's [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/tips-learning-org-mode-emacs/][Some tips for learning Org Mode for Emacs]], her [[http://pages.sachachua.com/.emacs.d/Sacha.html][Emacs configuration]] and many of her [[http://sachachua.com/blog/category/emacs/][other articles]].
- Rainer König's [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE][OrgMode Tutorial]] video series.

This is the newest and most-in-flux section of my Emacs config, since I'm still learning org-mode myself.

I use =use-package= to load the =org= package, and put its configuration inside the corresponding sections for keybindings (=:bind=), custom variables (=:custom=), custom faces (=:custom-face=), hooks (=:hook=) and general configuration code (=:config=), respectively. The contents of each section is populated with the corresponding snippets that follow. See the sections below for the details on what goes into each configuration section, and some other configuration code that ends up outside this declaration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
  (use-package org
    ;;    :pin manual
    :load-path ("lisp/org-mode/lisp" "lisp/org-mode/lisp/contrib/lisp")
    :bind
    (:map org-mode-map
          <<org-mode-keybindings>>)
    :custom
      <<org-mode-custom-vars>>
    :custom-face
      <<org-mode-faces>>
    :hook
      <<org-mode-hooks>>
    :config
      <<org-mode-config>>)
#+end_src

** General Org Configuration

Note that mode-specific configuration variables are defined under  their corresponding packages, this  section defines only global org-mode configuration variables, which are inserted in the main =use-package= declaration for =org-mode=.

- Default directory for org files (not all are stored here).

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no  :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
    (org-directory "~/org")
  #+end_src

- Automatically log done times in todo items.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
    (org-log-done t)
  #+end_src

- Keep the indentation well structured by setting =org-startup-indented= to =t=. This is a must have. Makes it feel less like editing a big text file and more like a purpose built editor for org-mode that forces the indentation. Thanks [[https://github.com/nickanderson/Level-up-your-notes-with-Org/blob/master/Level-up-your-notes-with-Org.org#automatic-visual-indention][Nick]] for the tip!

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
    (org-startup-indented t)
  #+end_src

  By default, =org-indent= produces an indicator ="Ind"= in the modeline. We use diminish to hide it. I also like to increase  the indentation a bit so that  the levels are more visible.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package org-indent
      :ensure nil
      :diminish
      :custom
      (org-indent-indentation-per-level 4))
  #+end_src

- Log stuff into the LOGBOOK drawer by default

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
    (org-log-into-drawer t)
  #+end_src

** General Org  Keybindings

Note that other keybindings are configured under their corresponding packages, this section defines only global org-mode keybindings, which are inserted in the main =use-package= declaration for =org-mode=.

- Use the special ~C-a~, ~C-e~ and ~C-k~ definitions for Org, which enable some special behavior in headings.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
   (org-special-ctrl-a/e t)
   (org-special-ctrl-k t)
  #+end_src

- Set up =C-c l= to store a link to the current org object, in counterpart to the default =C-c C-l= to insert a link.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-keybindings
    ("C-c l" . org-store-link)
  #+end_src

- The default keybinding for =org-mark-element= is =M-h=, which in macOS hides the current application, so I bind it to =A-h=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-keybindings
    ("A-h" . org-mark-element)
  #+end_src

Enable [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Speed-keys.html][Speed Keys]], which allows quick single-key commands when the cursor is placed on a heading. Usually the cursor needs to be at the beginning of a headline line, but defining it with this function makes them active on any of the asterisks at the beginning of the line (useful with the [[*Beautifying org-mode][font highlighting I use]], as all but the last asterisk are sometimes not visible).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
  (org-use-speed-commands
   (lambda ()
     (and (looking-at org-outline-regexp)
          (looking-back "^\**"))))
#+end_src

** Capturing stuff

First, I define some global keybindings  to open my frequently-used org files (original tip from [[https://sachachua.com/blog/2015/02/learn-take-notes-efficiently-org-mode/][Learn how to take notes more efficiently in Org Mode]]).

I define a helper function to define keybindings that open files. Since I use the =which-key= package, it also defines the description of the key that will appear in the =which-key= menu. Note the use of =lexical-let= so that  the =lambda= creates a closure, otherwise the keybindings don't work.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun zz/add-file-keybinding (key file &optional desc)
    (lexical-let ((key key)
                  (file file)
                  (desc desc))
      (global-set-key (kbd key) (lambda () (interactive) (find-file file)))
      (which-key-add-key-based-replacements key (or desc file))))
  #+end_src

Now I define keybindings to access my commonly-used org files, and add them to =org-agenda-files=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables '(org-agenda-files
                          '("~/gtd" "~/Work/work.org.gpg" "~/org/ideas.org" "~/org/projects.org" "~/org/diary.org")))
  (zz/add-file-keybinding "C-c f w" "~/Work/work.org.gpg" "work.org")
  (zz/add-file-keybinding "C-c f i" "~/org/ideas.org" "ideas.org")
  (zz/add-file-keybinding "C-c f p" "~/org/projects.org" "projects.org")
  (zz/add-file-keybinding "C-c f d" "~/org/diary.org" "diary.org")
#+end_src

=org-capture= provides  a generic and extensible interface  to capturing things  into org-mode in  different formats. I set up ~C-c c~  as the default  keybinding for triggering =org-capture=. Usually setting up a new capture template requires  some custom code,  which  gets defined in  the corresponding package config sections and included in the =:config= section below.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
  (use-package org-capture
    :ensure nil
    :after org
    :defer 1
    :bind
    ("C-c c" . org-capture)
    :config
    <<org-capture-config>>
    )
#+end_src

Define all my org agenda files as targets for refiling.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-refile-targets '((nil :maxlevel . 9)
                             (org-agenda-files :maxlevel . 9)))
  (setq org-outline-path-complete-in-steps nil)         ; Refile in a single go
  (setq org-refile-use-outline-path t)                  ; Show full paths for refiling
#+end_src
** Task tracking

Org-Agenda is the umbrella for all todo, journal, calendar, and other views. I set up =C-c a= to call up agenda mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-agenda
    :ensure nil
    :after org
    :bind
    ("C-c a" . org-agenda)
    :custom
    (org-agenda-include-diary t)
    (org-agenda-prefix-format '((agenda . " %i %-12:c%?-12t% s")
                                ;; Indent todo items by level to show nesting
                                (todo . " %i %-12:c%l")
                                (tags . " %i %-12:c")
                                (search . " %i %-12:c")))
    (org-agenda-start-on-weekday nil))

#+end_src

I also provide some customization for the =holidays= package, since its entries are included in the Org Agenda through the =org-agenda-include-diary= integration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package mexican-holidays
    :defer nil)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (quelpa '(swiss-holidays :fetcher github :repo "egli/swiss-holidays"))
  (require 'swiss-holidays)
  (setq swiss-holidays-zh-city-holidays
        '((holiday-float 4 1 3 "Sechseläuten") ;; meistens dritter Montag im April
          (holiday-float 9 1 3 "Knabenschiessen"))) ;; zweites Wochenende im September
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package holidays
    :defer nil
    :ensure nil
    :init
    (require 'mexican-holidays)
    :config
    (setq calendar-holidays
          (append '((holiday-fixed 1 1 "New Year's Day")
                    (holiday-fixed 2 14 "Valentine's Day")
                    (holiday-fixed 4 1 "April Fools' Day")
                    (holiday-fixed 10 31 "Halloween")
                    (holiday-easter-etc)
                    (holiday-fixed 12 25 "Christmas")
                    (solar-equinoxes-solstices))
                  swiss-holidays

                  swiss-holidays-zh-city-holidays
                  holiday-mexican-holidays)))
#+end_src

[[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda][org-super-agenda]] provides great grouping and customization features to make agenda mode easier to use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-habit)
  (use-package org-super-agenda

    :custom
    (org-super-agenda-groups '((:auto-dir-name t)))
    :config
    (org-super-agenda-mode))
#+end_src

I configure =org-archive= to archive completed TODOs by default to the =archive.org= file in the same directory as the source file, under the "date tree" corresponding to the task's CLOSED date - this allows me to easily separate work from non-work stuff. Note that this can be overridden for specific files by specifying the desired value of =org-archive-location= in the =#+archive:= property at the top of the file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-archive
    :ensure nil
    :custom

** Building presentations

[[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][org-reveal]] is an awesome package for building presentations with org-mode. The MELPA version of the package gives me a conflict with my hand-installed version of org-mode, so I also install it by hand and load it directly from its checked-out repository.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ox-reveal
    :load-path ("lisp/org-reveal")
    :defer 3
    :after org

** Various exporters

One of the big strengths of org-mode is the ability to export a document in many different formats. Here I load some of the exporters I have found useful.

- HTML

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package ox-html
      :ensure nil
      :defer 3
      :after org
      :custom

  #+end_src

- Markdown

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package ox-md
      :ensure nil
      :defer 3
      :after org)
  #+end_src

- [[https://github.com/stig/ox-jira.el][Jira markup]]. I also load =org-jira=, which provides a full interface to Jira through org-mode.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package ox-jira
      :defer 3
      :after org)

** Blogging with Hugo

[[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] is an awesome way to blog from org-mode. It makes it possible for posts in org-mode format to be kept separate, and it generates the Markdown files for Hugo. Hugo [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/][supports org files]], but using ox-hugo has multiple advantages:

- Parsing is done by org-mode natively, not by an external library. Although goorgeous (used by Hugo) is very good, it still lacks in many areas, which leads to text being interpreted differently as by org-mode.
- Hugo is left to parse a native Markdown file, which means that many of its features such as shortcodes, TOC generation, etc., can still be used on the generated file.
- I am intrigued by ox-hugo's "one post per org subtree" proposed structure. So far I've always had one file per post, but with org-mode's structuring features, it might make sense to give it a try.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Configure a capture template for creating new ox-hugo blog posts, from [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/org-capture-setup][ox-hugo's Org Capture Setup]].

#+end_src

** Encryption

First, load the built-in EasyPG support. By calling =(epa-file-enable)=, Emacs automatically encrypts/decrypts files with a =.gpg= extension. By default it asks about the key to use, but I configure it to always use my own GPG key.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package epa-file
    :ensure nil ;; included with Emacs
    :config
    (setq epa-file-encrypt-to '("diego@zzamboni.org"))
    :custom
    (epa-file-select-keys 'silent))
#+end_src

Then, load [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/encrypting-files.html][org-crypt]] to enable selective  encryption/decryption using GPG within org-mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-crypt
    :ensure nil  ;; included with org-mode
    :after org
    :config
    (org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
    (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote ("crypt")))
    :custom
    (org-crypt-key "diego@zzamboni.org"))
#+end_src

** Keeping a Journal

I use [[http://750words.com/][750words]] for my personal Journal, and I used  to write my entries locally using Scrivener. Now I am using  =org-journal= for this, works quite well  together with =wc-mode= to keep  a count of how many words I have written.

In order to keep my journal entries encrypted there are two separate but confusingly named mechanisms:

- =org-journal-encrypt-journal=, if set to =t= has the effect of transparently encrypting/decrypting the journal files as they are written to disk. This is what  I use.
- =org-journal-enable-encryption=, if set to =t=, enables integration with =org-crypt= (see above),  so it automatically adds a =:crypt:= tag to new journal entries. This has the effect of automatically encrypting those entries upon save, replacing them with a blob of gpg-encrypted text which has to be further decrypted with =org-decrypt-entry= in order to read or edit them again. I have disabled it for now to make it more transparent to  work with my journal entries while I am editing them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-journal
    :after org
    :custom
    (org-journal-dir (concat (file-name-as-directory org-directory) "journal"))
    (org-journal-file-format "%Y/%m/%Y%m%d")
    (org-journal-date-format "%A, %Y-%m-%d")
    (org-journal-encrypt-journal t)
    (org-journal-enable-encryption nil)
    (org-journal-enable-agenda-integration t)
    :bind
    ("C-c j" . org-journal-new-entry))
#+end_src

** Literate programming

Org-mode is the first literate programming tool that seems practical and useful, since it's easy to edit, execute and document code from within the same tool (Emacs) using all of its existing capabilities (i.e. each code block can be edited in its native Emacs mode, taking full advantage of indentation, completion, etc.)

First, we load the necessary programming language support. The base features and literate programming for Emacs LISP is built-in, but the =ob-*= packages provide the ability to execute code in different languages directly from within the Org buffer, beyond those included with org-mode. I load the modules for some of the languages I use frequently:

- CFEngine, used extensively for my book [[https://cf-learn.info][/Learning CFEngine/]].

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package ob-cfengine3
      :after org)
  #+end_src

- Elvish, my favorite shell.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package ob-elvish
      :after org)
  #+end_src

- The [[http://plantuml.com/][PlantUML]] graph language.

  We determine the location of the PlantUML jar file automatically from the installed Homebrew formula.

  #+name: plantuml-jar-path
  #+begin_src shell :tangle no :noweb-ref plantuml-jar-command :exports both
    brew list plantuml | grep jar
  #+end_src

Which in my current setup results in the following:

  #+RESULTS: plantuml-jar-path
  : /usr/local/Cellar/plantuml/1.2020.15/libexec/plantuml.jar

  The command defined above is used to define the value of the =homebrew-plantuml-jar-path= variable. If you don't use Homebrew of have installed PlantUML some other way, you need to modify this command, or hard-code the path.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes
    (require 'subr-x)
    (setq homebrew-plantuml-jar-path
          (expand-file-name
           (string-trim
            (shell-command-to-string "<<plantuml-jar-command>>"))))
  #+end_src

  Finally, we use this value to configure both =plantuml-mode= (for syntax highlighting) and =ob-plantuml= (for evaluating PlantUML code and inserting the results in exported Org documents).

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes
    (use-package plantuml-mode
      :custom
      (plantuml-jar-path homebrew-plantuml-jar-path))

    (use-package ob-plantuml
      :ensure nil
      :after org
      :custom
      (org-plantuml-jar-path homebrew-plantuml-jar-path))
  #+end_src

- Define =shell-script-mode= as an alias for =console-mode=, so that =console= src blocks can be edited and are fontified correctly.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defalias 'console-mode 'shell-script-mode)
  #+end_src

- Finally, from all  the available languages, we configure the  ones for which to load =org-babel= support.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-config
    (org-babel-do-load-languages
     'org-babel-load-languages
     '((cfengine3 . t)
       (ruby      . t)
       (latex     . t)
       (plantuml  . t)
       (python    . t)
       (shell     . t)
       (elvish    . t)
       (calc      . t)
       (dot       . t)
       (ditaa     . t)
       (org       . t)))
  #+end_src

Now, we configure some other =org-babel= settings:

- Tangle-on-save has revolutionized my literate programming workflow. It automatically runs =org-babel-tangle= upon saving any org-mode buffer, which means the resulting files will be automatically kept up to date. For a long time I simply had the following hook:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-hooks
    (org-mode . (lambda () (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'org-babel-tangle :append :local)))
  #+end_src

  This is simple and it works, the only disadvantage is that it runs the tangle process synchronously, so Emacs freezes until the =org-babel-tangle= command is done. For large files (such as this one), the delay is noticeable, so I also had some hooks to measure and report the tangle time:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-config-disabled
    (defun zz/report-tangle-time (start-time)
      (message "org-babel-tangle took %s"
               (format "%.2f seconds"
                       (float-time (time-since start-time)))))
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-hooks-disabled
    (org-babel-pre-tangle  . (lambda ()
                               (setq zz/pre-tangle-time (current-time))))
    (org-babel-post-tangle . (lambda ()
                               (zz/report-tangle-time zz/pre-tangle-time)))
  #+end_src

  Thanks to [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2019-12/msg00191.html][the kind help of Ihor in the emacs-orgmode mailing list]], I now have an asynchronous version of this, which dispatches the tangle function to a subprocess, so that the main Emacs is not blocked while it runs. The =zz/org-babel-tangle-async= function uses the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async][emacs-async]] package to start the tangle operation in a child process. Note that the child Emacs started by =async-start= is empty, without any configuration, so we need to load =org= before tangling. Depending on your setup, you may need to load more configuration.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defun zz/org-babel-tangle-async (file)
      "Invoke `org-babel-tangle-file' asynchronously."
      (message "Tangling %s..." (buffer-file-name))
      (async-start
       (let ((args (list file)))
         `(lambda ()
            (require 'org)
            ;;(load "~/.emacs.d/init.el")
            (let ((start-time (current-time)))
              (apply #'org-babel-tangle-file ',args)
              (format "%.2f" (float-time (time-since start-time))))))
       (let ((message-string (format "Tangling %S completed after " file)))
         `(lambda (tangle-time)
            (message (concat ,message-string
                             (format "%s seconds" tangle-time)))))))

    (defun zz/org-babel-tangle-current-buffer-async ()
      "Tangle current buffer asynchronously."
      (zz/org-babel-tangle-async (buffer-file-name)))
    #+end_src

  Finally, we set up an =org-mode= hook which adds the async tangle function to the =after-save-hook=, so that it happens automatically after every save. Disabled for now because the tangle is getting interrupted sometimes when I move the cursor before the async tangle finishes, leaving files incomplete.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-hooks-disabled
    (org-mode . (lambda () (add-hook 'after-save-hook
                                     'zz/org-babel-tangle-current-buffer-async
                                     'run-at-end 'only-in-org-mode)))
  #+end_src

- This is potentially dangerous: it suppresses the query before executing code from within org-mode. I use it because I am very careful and only press =C-c C-c= on blocks I absolutely understand.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
  (org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
  #+end_src

- This makes it so that code within =src= blocks is fontified according to their corresponding Emacs mode, making the file much more readable.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
  (org-src-fontify-natively t)
  #+end_src

- In principle this makes it so that indentation in =src= blocks works as in their native mode, but in my experience it does not always work reliably. For full proper indentation, always edit the code in a native buffer by pressing =C-c '=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
  (org-src-tab-acts-natively t)
  #+end_src

- Automatically show inline images, useful when executing code that produces them, such as PlantUML or Graphviz.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-hooks

  #+end_src

** Beautifying org-mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: beautifying-org-mode
:END:

*** Emphasis, lists and bullets

These settings make org-mode much more readable by using different fonts for headings, hiding some of the markup, etc. This was taken originally from Howard Abrams' [[http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/orgmode-wordprocessor.html][Org as a Word Processor]], and subsequently tweaked and broken up in the different parts of the =use-package= declaration by me.

First, we set =org-hid-emphasis-markers= so that the markup indicators are not shown.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
  (org-hide-emphasis-markers t)
#+end_src

We add an entry to the org-mode font-lock table so that list markers are shown with a middle dot instead of the original character.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-config
  (font-lock-add-keywords
   'org-mode
   '(("^ *\\([-]\\) "
      (0 (prog1 () (compose-region (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1) "•"))))))
#+end_src

We use the =org-bullets= package to display the titles with nice unicode bullets instead of the text ones.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-bullets
    :after org
    :hook
    (org-mode . (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1))))
#+end_src

Prettify checkbox lists and other symbols - courtesy of https://blog.jft.rocks/emacs/unicode-for-orgmode-checkboxes.html. First, we add special characters for checkboxes:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-hooks
    (org-mode . (lambda ()
                  "Beautify Org Checkbox Symbol"
                  (push '("[ ]" . "☐" ) prettify-symbols-alist)
                  (push '("[X]" . "☑" ) prettify-symbols-alist)
                  (push '("[-]" . "⊡" ) prettify-symbols-alist)
                  (prettify-symbols-mode)))
  #+end_src

  Show symbols when the cursor is over of right after them.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
    (prettify-symbols-unprettify-at-point 'right-edge)
  #+end_src

  Second, we define a special face for checked items.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-config
    (defface org-checkbox-done-text
      '((t (:foreground "#71696A" :strike-through t)))
      "Face for the text part of a checked org-mode checkbox.")

    (font-lock-add-keywords
     'org-mode
     `(("^[ \t]*\\(?:[-+*]\\|[0-9]+[).]\\)[ \t]+\\(\\(?:\\[@\\(?:start:\\)?[0-9]+\\][ \t]*\\)?\\[\\(?:X\\|\\([0-9]+\\)/\\2\\)\\][^\n]*\n\\)"
        1 'org-checkbox-done-text prepend))
     'append)
  #+end_src

*** Headings

We choose a nice font for the document title and the section headings. The first one found in the system from the list below is used, and the same font is used for the different levels, in varying sizes.

*** Fonts and wrapping

I use proportional fonts in org-mode for the text, while keeping fixed-width fonts for blocks, so that source code, tables, etc. are shown correctly. These settings include:

- Setting up the =variable-pitch= face to the proportional font I like to use. My current favorite is [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/][ET Book]], in the past I have used [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Sans_Pro][Source Sans Pro]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenir_(typeface)][Avenir Next]].
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-faces
    (variable-pitch ((t (:family "ETBembo" :height 180 :weight thin))))
    ;;(variable-pitch ((t (:family "Avenir Next" :height 160 :weight light))))
  #+end_src

- Setting up the =fixed-pitch= face to be the same as my usual =default= face. My current one is +[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconsolata][Inconsolata]]+ [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code]]
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-faces
;;    (fixed-pitch ((t (:family "Inconsolata Nerd Font"))))
    (fixed-pitch ((t (:family "Fira Code Retina" :height 160))))
  #+end_src

- Configure =org-indent= to inherit from =fixed-pitch= to fix the vertical spacing in code blocks. Thanks to Ben for the tip!
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-faces
    (org-indent ((t (:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch)))))
  #+end_src

- Configure =org-fontify-done-headline= to apply a special face to DONE items in org-mode, and configure the =org-done= face to be used.  Note that  =org-done= only applies to the "DONE" keyword itself, the face for the rest of a "done" headline is defined above as the =org-headline-done= face.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
    (org-fontify-done-headline t)
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-faces
    (org-done ((t (:foreground "PaleGreen"
                               :strike-through t))))
  #+end_src

- Configuring the corresponding =org-mode= faces for blocks, verbatim code, and maybe a couple of other things. As these change more frequently, I do them directly from the =customize-face= interface, you can see their current settings in the [[*Customized variables][Customized variables]] section.

- Setting up =visual-line-mode= and making all my paragraphs one single line, so that the lines wrap around nicely in the window according to their proportional-font size, instead of at a fixed character count, which does not work so nicely when characters have varying widths. I set up a hook that automatically enables =visual-line-mode= and =variable-pitch-mode= when entering org-mode.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-hooks
    (org-mode . visual-line-mode)
    (org-mode . variable-pitch-mode)
  #+end_src

  Turns out =visual-line-mode= also remaps the ~C-a~ and ~C-e~ keybindings (of course, which breaks the behavior enabled by the =org-special-ctrl-a/e/k= variables. To counter this, I also add some bindings that set those keys to their Org functions. These functions know how to deal with visual mode anyway.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-keybindings
    ("C-a" . org-beginning-of-line)
    ("C-e" . org-end-of-line)
    ("C-k" . org-kill-line)
  #+end_src

- In =variable-pitch= mode, the default right-alignment for headline tags doesn't work, and results in the tags being misaligned (as it uses character positions to do the alignment). This setting positions the tags right after the last character of the headline, so at least they are more consistent.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
    (org-tags-column 0)
  #+end_src

- I also set =org-todo-keyword-faces= to highlight different  types of org-mode TODO items with different colors.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-custom-vars
    (org-todo-keyword-faces
     '(("AREA"         . "DarkOrchid1")
       ("[AREA]"       . "DarkOrchid1")
       ("PROJECT"      . "DarkOrchid1")
       ("[PROJECT]"    . "DarkOrchid1")
       ("INBOX"        . "cyan")
       ("[INBOX]"      . "cyan")
       ("PROPOSAL"     . "orange")
       ("[PROPOSAL]"   . "orange")
       ("DRAFT"        . "yellow3")
       ("[DRAFT]"      . "yellow3")
       ("INPROGRESS"   . "yellow4")
       ("[INPROGRESS]" . "yellow4")
       ("MEETING"      . "purple")
       ("[MEETING]"    . "purple")
       ("CANCELED"     . "blue")
       ("[CANCELED]"   . "blue")))
  #+end_src

  These two modes produce modeline indicators, which I disable using =diminish=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref org-mode-config
    (eval-after-load 'face-remap '(diminish 'buffer-face-mode))
    (eval-after-load 'simple '(diminish 'visual-line-mode))
  #+end_src

*** "Focused Writing" mode

I'm experimenting with some settings based on [[https://lepisma.xyz/2017/10/28/ricing-org-mode/][Ricing up Org Mode]], particularly for using when writing, to avoid distractions. For now these are contained within a function that I can call to enable them, to give me a chance to experiment.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defun zz/write ()
      (interactive)
      ;; Line spacing
      (setq line-spacing 0.1)
      ;; Top padding
      (setq header-line-format " ")
      ;; Hide modeline
      (hide-mode-line-mode)
      ;;(setq mode-line-format nil)
      ;; Side padding
      (setq left-margin-width 2)
      (setq right-margin-width 2)
      (set-window-buffer nil (current-buffer)))
  #+end_src

  The function above uses [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-hide-mode-line][hide-mode-line]] mode.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package hide-mode-line)
  #+end_src

*** Source code blocks

The following code ([[https://pank.eu/blog/pretty-babel-src-blocks.html][by Rasmus]]) prettifies org-mode's source blocks by replacing the =#+begin/end_src= keywords and the header arguments with symbols. In my config, the following code:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (defvar zzamboni/test-symbol ?✎
    "This is a test symbol")
#+end_src

  Looks like this:

#+attr_org: :width 500
[[file:images/my-emacs-configuration-with-commentary/2020-03-17_09-54-28_screenshot.png]]

  When the cursor is over or next to one of the symbols, it gets expanded into its text representation to make editing easier. This is enabled by setting =prettify-symbols-unprettify-at-point= to ='right-edge=:

** Auto-generated table of contents

The =toc-org= package allows us to insert a table of contents in headings marked with =:TOC:=. This is useful for org files that are to be viewed directly on GitHub, which renders org files correctly, but does not generate a table of contents at the top. For an example, see [[https://github.com/zzamboni/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.org][this file on GitHub]].

Note that this breaks HTML export by default, as the links generated by =toc-org= cannot be parsed properly by the html exporter. The [[https://github.com/snosov1/toc-org/issues/35#issuecomment-275096511][workaround]] is to use =:TOC:noexport:= as the marker, which removed the generated TOC from the export, but still allows =ox-html= to insert its own TOC at the top.

** Grabbing links from different Mac applications

** Reformatting an Org buffer

I picked up this little gem in the org mailing list. A function that reformats the current buffer by regenerating the text from its internal parsed representation. Quite amazing.

** Code for org-mode macros

Here I define functions which get used in some of my org-mode macros

The first is a support function which gets used in some of the following, to return a string (or an optional custom  string) only if  it  is a non-zero, non-whitespace string,  and =nil= otherwise.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun zz/org-if-str (str &optional desc)
    (when (org-string-nw-p str)
      (or (org-string-nw-p desc) str)))
#+end_src

This function receives three arguments, and returns the org-mode code for a link to the Hammerspoon API documentation for the =link= module, optionally to a specific =function=. If =desc= is passed, it is used as the display text, otherwise =section.function= is used.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun zz/org-macro-hsapi-code (module &optional func desc)
    (org-link-make-string
     (concat "https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/"
             (concat module (zz/org-if-str func (concat "#" func))))
     (or (org-string-nw-p desc)
         (format "=%s="
                 (concat module
                         (zz/org-if-str func (concat "." func)))))))
#+end_src

Split STR at spaces and wrap each element with the =~= char, separated by =+=. Zero-width spaces are inserted around the plus signs so that they get formatted correctly. Envisioned use is for formatting keybinding descriptions. There are two versions of this function: "outer" wraps each element in  =~=, the "inner" wraps the whole sequence in them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun zz/org-macro-keys-code-outer (str)
    (mapconcat (lambda (s)
                 (concat "~" s "~"))
               (split-string str)
               (concat (string ?\u200B) "+" (string ?\u200B))))
  (defun zz/org-macro-keys-code-inner (str)
    (concat "~" (mapconcat (lambda (s)
                             (concat s))
                           (split-string str)
                           (concat (string ?\u200B) "-" (string ?\u200B)))
            "~"))
  (defun zz/org-macro-keys-code (str)

** Publishing to LeanPub

I use [[https://leanpub.com/][LeanPub]] for self-publishing [[https://leanpub.com/u/zzamboni][my books]]. Fortunately, it is possible to export from org-mode to both [[https://leanpub.com/lfm/read][LeanPub-flavored Markdown]] and [[https://leanpub.com/markua/read][Markua]], the new preferred Leanpub markup format, so I can use Org for writing the text and simply export it in the correct format and structure needed by Leanpub.

When I decided to use org-mode to write my books, I looked around for existing modules and code. Here are some of the resources I found:
- [[http://juanreyero.com/open/ox-leanpub/index.html][Description of ox-leanpub.el]] ([[https://github.com/juanre/ox-leanpub][GitHub repo]]) by [[http://juanreyero.com/about/][Juan Reyero]];
- [[https://medium.com/@lakshminp/publishing-a-book-using-org-mode-9e817a56d144][Publishing a book using org-mode]] by [[https://medium.com/@lakshminp/publishing-a-book-using-org-mode-9e817a56d144][Lakshmi Narasimhan]];
- [[http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5313][Publishing a Book with Leanpub and Org Mode]] by Jon Snader (from where I found the links to the above).

Building upon these, I have developed a new =ox-leanpub= package which you can find in MELPA (source at [[https://github.com/zzamboni/ox-leanpub]]), and which I load and configure below.

The =ox-leanpub= module sets up Markua export automatically, and I add the code for setting up the Markdown exporter too (I don't use it, but just to keep an eye on any breakage):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ox-leanpub
    :defer 1
    :after org
    :config
    (require 'ox-leanpub-markdown)
    (org-leanpub-book-setup-menu-markdown))
#+end_src

I highly recommend using Markua rather than Markdown, as it is the future that Leanpub is guaranteed to support in the future, and where most of the new features are being developed.

With this setup, I can write my book in org-mode (I usually keep a single =book.org= file at the top of my repository), and then call the corresponding "Book" export commands. The =manuscript= directory, as well as the corresponding =Book.txt= and other necessary files are created and populated automatically.

** Miscellaneous org functions and configuration

Utility =org-get-keyword= function (from the org-mode mailing list) to get the value of file-level properties.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun org-get-keyword (key)
    (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer 'element) 'keyword
      (lambda (k)
        (when (string= key (org-element-property :key k))
          (org-element-property :value k)))
      nil t))
#+end_src

[[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sidebar][org-sidebar]] provides a configurable sidebar  to org buffers, showing the agenda, headlines, etc.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-sidebar)
#+end_src

* Appearance, buffer/file management and theming

Here we take care of all the visual, UX and desktop-management settings.

You'll notice that many of the packages in this section have =:defer nil=. This is because some of these package are never called explicitly because they operate in the background, but I want them loaded when Emacs starts so they can perform their necessary customization.

Emacs 26 (which I am trying now) introduces pixel-level scrolling.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (when (>= emacs-major-version 26)
    (pixel-scroll-mode))
#+end_src


The =diminish= package makes it possible to remove clutter from the modeline. Here we just load it, it gets enabled for individual packages in their corresponding declarations.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package diminish
    :defer 1)
#+end_src

I have been playing with different themes, and I have settled for now with =spacemacs-light=. Some of my other favorites are also here so I don't forget about them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;;(use-package solarized-theme)
  ;;(use-package darktooth-theme)
  ;;(use-package kaolin-themes)
  ;;(use-package gruvbox-theme)
  (use-package spacemacs-theme)
  (load-theme 'spacemacs-light)
#+end_src

Install [[https://github.com/Malabarba/smart-mode-line][smart-mode-line]] for modeline goodness, including configurable abbreviation of directories, and other things.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package smart-mode-line
    :defer 2
    :config
    (sml/setup)
    :custom
    (sml/theme 'respectful)
    (sml/replacer-regexp-list
     '(("^~/\\.emacs\\.d/elpa/"                            ":ELPA:")
       ("^~/\\.emacs\\.d/"                                 ":ED:")
       ("^/sudo:.*:"                                       ":SU:")
       ("^~/Documents/"                                    ":Doc:")
       ("^:\\([^:]*\\):Documento?s/"                       ":\\1/Doc:")
       ("^~/Dropbox/"                                      ":DB:")
       ("^:DB:org"                                         ":Org:")
       ("^:DB:Personal/"                                   ":P:")
       ("^:DB:Personal/writing/"                           ":Write:")
       ("^:P:devel/"                                       ":Dev:")
       ("^:Write:learning-cfengine-3/learning-cfengine-3/" ":cf-learn:")
       ("^:Dev:go/src/github.com/elves/elvish/"            ":elvish:")
       ("^:Dev:zzamboni.org/zzamboni.org/"                 ":zz.org:"))))
#+end_src

Enable desktop-save mode, which saves the current buffer configuration on exit and reloads it on restart.

Desktop mode also includes the =desktop-clear= function, which can be used to kill all open buffers. I bind it to ~Control-Meta-super-k~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package desktop
    :defer nil
    :custom
    (desktop-restore-eager   1 "Restore the first buffer right away")
    (desktop-lazy-idle-delay 1 "Restore the other buffers 1 second later")
    (desktop-lazy-verbose  nil "Be silent about lazily opening buffers")
    :bind
    ("C-M-s-k" . desktop-clear)
    :config
    (desktop-save-mode))
#+end_src

The =uniquify= package makes it much easier to identify different open files with the same name by prepending/appending their directory or some other information to them. I configure it to add the directory name after the filename. =uniquify= is included with Emacs, so I specify =:ensure nil= so that =use-package= doesn't try to install it, and just loads and configures it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package uniquify
    :defer 1
    :ensure nil
    :custom
    (uniquify-after-kill-buffer-p t)
    (uniquify-buffer-name-style 'post-forward)
    (uniquify-strip-common-suffix t))
#+end_src

I like to highlight the current line. For this I use the built-in =hl-line=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes
  (use-package hl-line
    :disabled
    :defer nil
    :config
    <<hl-line custom line-range function>>
    (global-hl-line-mode))
#+end_src

I also provide a custom value for =hl-line-range-function= (thanks to Eric on the [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2019-10/msg00303.html][org-mode mailing list]] for the tip) which highlights only the current visual line in =visual-line-mode=, which I use for Org-mode files (see [[*Beautifying org-mode][Beautifying org-mode]]).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no :noweb-ref hl-line custom line-range function
  (defun zz/get-visual-line-range ()
    (let (b e)
      (save-excursion
        (beginning-of-visual-line)
        (setq b (point))
        (end-of-visual-line)
        (setq e (+ 1 (point)))
        )
      (cons b e)))
  (setq hl-line-range-function #'zz/get-visual-line-range)
#+end_src

I have also experimented with highlighting the current column. At the moment the code below is all disabled because I find it too distracting, but I'm leaving it  here for reference. I found two options to achieve this:

- The =col-highlight= package, which highlights the column only after a defined interval has passed
- The =crosshairs= package, which always highlights both the column and the line. It also has a "highlight crosshairs when idle" mode, but I prefer to have the current line always highlighted.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package col-highlight
    :disabled
    :defer nil
    :config
    (col-highlight-toggle-when-idle)
    (col-highlight-set-interval 2))
  (use-package crosshairs
    :disabled
    :defer nil
    :config
    (crosshairs-mode))
#+end_src

I also use =recentf= to keep a list of recently open buffers. These are visible in helm's open-file mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package recentf
    :defer 1
    :custom
    (recentf-max-menu-items 100)
    (recentf-max-saved-items 100)
    :init
    (recentf-mode))
#+end_src

The [[http://martinowen.net/blog/2010/02/03/tips-for-emacs-ibuffer.html][ibuffer]] package allows all sort of useful operations on the list of open buffers. I haven't customized it yet, but I have a keybinding to open it. (Disabled for now as I am using helm's =helm-buffer-list=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ibuffer
    :disabled
    :bind
    ("C-x C-b" . ibuffer))
#+end_src

The [[https://github.com/nonsequitur/smex][smex]] package is incredibly useful, adding IDO integration and some other very nice features to =M-x=, which make it easier to discover and use Emacs commands. Highly recommended. (Disabled for now as I'm using helm's =helm-M-x=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package smex
    :disabled
    :bind (("M-x" . smex))
    :config (smex-initialize))
#+end_src

[[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MidnightMode][midnight-mode]] purges buffers which haven't been displayed in 3 days. We configure the period so that the cleanup happens every 2 hours (7200 seconds).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package midnight
    :defer 3
    :config
    (setq midnight-period 7200)
    (midnight-mode 1))
#+end_src

For distraction-free writing, I'm testing out =writeroom-mode=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package writeroom-mode)
#+end_src

[[https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree][NeoTree]] shows a navigation tree on a sidebar, and allows a number of operations on the files and directories. I'm not much of a fan of this type of interface in Emacs, but I have set it up to check it out.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package neotree
    :custom
    (neo-theme (if (display-graphic-p) 'icons 'arrow))
    (neo-smart-open t)
    (projectile-switch-project-action 'neotree-projectile-action)
    :config
    (defun neotree-project-dir ()
      "Open NeoTree using the git root."
      (interactive)
      (let ((project-dir (projectile-project-root))
            (file-name (buffer-file-name)))
        (neotree-toggle)
        (if project-dir
            (if (neo-global--window-exists-p)
                (progn
                  (neotree-dir project-dir)
                  (neotree-find file-name)))
          (message "Could not find git project root."))))
    :bind
    ([f8] . neotree-project-dir))
#+end_src

=wc-mode= allows counting characters and words, both on demand and continuously. It also allows setting up a word/character goal.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package wc-mode
    :defer 3
    :hook
    (org-journal-mode . wc-mode))
#+end_src

The =all-the-icons= package provides a number of useful icons.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package all-the-icons
    :defer 3)
#+end_src

** Completion: IDO or Helm?

The [[https://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html][battle]] [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11100312][rages]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3o36sc/what_do_you_prefer_ido_or_helm/][on]] - [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] or [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings][IDO]]? Both are nice completion frameworks for Emacs, and both integrate nicely with most main Emacs functions, including file opening, command and buffer selection, etc. I was using IDO for some time but are now giving helm a try. Both my configs are shown below, but only Helm is enabled at the moment.

Should I also look at [[https://sam217pa.github.io/2016/09/13/from-helm-to-ivy/][ivy]]?

*** IDO

I use [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-to-ido-mode][IDO mode]] to get better matching capabilities everywhere in Emacs (disabled while I give helm a try, see below).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ido
    :disabled
    :config
    (ido-mode t)
    (ido-everywhere 1)
    (setq ido-use-virtual-buffers t)
    (setq ido-enable-flex-matching t)
    (setq ido-use-filename-at-point nil)
    (setq ido-auto-merge-work-directories-length -1))

  (use-package ido-completing-read+
    :disabled
    :config
    (ido-ubiquitous-mode 1))
#+end_src

*** Helm

This config came originally from [[https://github.com/daedreth/UncleDavesEmacs#user-content-ido-and-why-i-started-using-helm][Uncle Dave's Emacs config]], though I have tweaked it a bit.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

* Coding

Coding is one of my primary uses for Emacs, although lately it has shifted toward more general writing. This used to be the largest section in my config until [[Org mode][Org mode]] overtook it :)

** General settings and modules

When enabled, =subword= allows navigating "sub words" individually in CamelCaseIdentifiers. For now I only enable it in =clojure-mode=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package subword
    :hook
    (clojure-mode . subword-mode))
#+end_src

With =aggressive-indent=, indentation is always kept up to date in the whole buffer. Sometimes it gets in the way, but in general it's nice and saves a lot of work, so I enable it for all programming modes except for Python mode, where I explicitly disable as it often gets the indentation wrong and messes up existing code.

Disabled for now while I test how much I miss it (I often find it gets in the way, but I'm not sure how often it helps and I don't even notice it)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package aggressive-indent
    :disabled
    :diminish aggressive-indent-mode
    :hook
    (prog-mode . aggressive-indent-mode)
    (python-mode . (lambda () (aggressive-indent-mode -1))))
#+end_src

With =company-mode=, we get automatic completion - when there are completions available, a popup menu will appear when you stop typing for a moment, and you can either continue typing or accept the completion using the Enter key. I enable it globally.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package company
    :diminish company-mode
    :hook
    (after-init . global-company-mode))
#+end_src

=projectile-mode= allows us to perform project-relative operations such as searches, navigation, etc.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package projectile
    :defer 2
    :diminish projectile-mode
    :config
    (projectile-global-mode))
#+end_src

I find =iedit= absolutely indispensable when coding. In short: when you hit =Ctrl-:=, all occurrences of the symbol under the cursor (or the current selection) are highlighted, and any changes you make on one of them will be automatically applied to all others. It's great for renaming variables in code, but it needs to be used with care, as it has no idea of semantics, it's  a plain string replacement, so it can inadvertently modify unintended parts of the code.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package iedit
    :config
    (set-face-background 'iedit-occurrence "Magenta")
    :bind
    ("C-;" . iedit-mode))
#+end_src

Turn on the online documentation mode for all programming modes (not all of them support it) and for the Clojure REPL =cider= mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package eldoc
    :diminish
    :hook
    (prog-mode       . turn-on-eldoc-mode)
    (cider-repl-mode . turn-on-eldoc-mode))
#+end_src

On-the-fly spell checking. I enable it for all text modes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package flyspell
    :defer 1
    :diminish)
#+end_src

** Clojure and LISP coding

I dabble in Clojure and Emacs LISP, and Emacs has some fantastic support for them. There's a number of packages and configuration related to this, so I have a whole section for it.

The centerpiece is of course =clojure-mode=. In addition to files ending in =.clj=, I bind it automatically to =.boot= files (both by extension and by [[https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/For-Emacs-Users][shebang line]]) and to the [[http://riemann.io/][Riemann]] config files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package clojure-mode
    :mode "\\.clj.*$"
    :mode "riemann.config"
    :mode "\\.boot"
    :config
    (add-to-list 'magic-mode-alist '(".* boot" . clojure-mode)))
#+end_src

Enable some additional fontification for Clojure code.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package clojure-mode-extra-font-locking)
#+end_src

The =cider= package provides a fantastic REPL built into Emacs. We configure a few aspects, including pretty printing, fontification, history size and others.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package cider
    :custom
    ;; nice pretty printing
    (cider-repl-use-pretty-printing nil)
    ;; nicer font lock in REPL
    (cider-repl-use-clojure-font-lock t)
    ;; result prefix for the REPL
    (cider-repl-result-prefix "; => ")
    ;; never ending REPL history
    (cider-repl-wrap-history t)
    ;; looong history
    (cider-repl-history-size 5000)
    ;; persistent history
    (cider-repl-history-file "~/.emacs.d/cider-history")
    ;; error buffer not popping up
    (cider-show-error-buffer nil)
    ;; go right to the REPL buffer when it's finished connecting
    (cider-repl-pop-to-buffer-on-connect t))
#+end_src

We use =clj-refactor= for supporting advanced code refactoring in Clojure.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package clj-refactor
    :config
    (defun my-clojure-mode-hook ()
      (clj-refactor-mode 1)
      (yas-minor-mode 1) ; for adding require/use/import statements
      ;; This choice of keybinding leaves cider-macroexpand-1 unbound
      (cljr-add-keybindings-with-prefix "C-c C-m"))
    :hook
    (clojure-mode . my-clojure-mode-hook))
#+end_src

Use =emr= for supporting refactoring in Emacs LISP and some other languages.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emr
    :config
    (bind-key "A-RET" 'emr-show-refactor-menu prog-mode-map))
#+end_src

When coding in LISP-like languages, =rainbow-delimiters= is a must-have - it marks each concentric pair of parenthesis with different colors, which makes it much easier to understand expressions and spot mistakes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package rainbow-delimiters
    :hook
    ((prog-mode cider-repl-mode) . rainbow-delimiters-mode))
#+end_src

Another useful addition for LISP coding - =smartparens= enforces parenthesis to match, and adds a number of useful operations for manipulating parenthesized expressions. I map =M-(= to enclose the next expression as in =paredit= using a custom function. Prefix argument can be used to indicate how many expressions to enclose instead of just 1. E.g. =C-u 3 M-(= will enclose the next 3 sexps.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun zz/sp-enclose-next-sexp (num)
    (interactive "p")
    (insert-parentheses (or num 1)))

  (use-package smartparens
    :diminish smartparens-mode
    :config
    (require 'smartparens-config)
    :custom
    (sp-base-key-bindings 'paredit)
    :hook
    ((clojure-mode
      emacs-lisp-mode
      lisp-mode

* Other tools

- The =rx= library makes it easier to express regular expressions (I know regex syntax, but in Emacs the quoting makes them very hard to read). The [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/xr.html][=xr=]] library is the inverse - can be used to convert regex strings to =rx= syntax, which makes it easier to learn by example.

* General text editing

In addition to coding, I configure some modes that can be used for text editing.

- [[http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/][AsciiDoc]], which I use for [[http://cf-learn.info/][my book]] and some other text. I also set up =visual-line-mode= and =variable-pitch-mode= here. =adoc-mode= is not so granular as =org-mode= with respect to face assignments, so the variable/fixed distinction does not always work, but it's still pretty good for long-text editing.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package adoc-mode
      :mode "\\.asciidoc\\'"
      :hook
      (adoc-mode . visual-line-mode)
      (adoc-mode . variable-pitch-mode))
  #+end_src

- [[https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax][Markdown]], generally useful. I also set up variable pitch and visual line mode.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package markdown-mode
      :hook
      (markdown-mode . visual-line-mode)
      (markdown-mode . variable-pitch-mode))
  #+end_src

- When [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TypographicalPunctuationMarks][typopunct]] is enabled (needs to be enabled by hand), automatically inserts “pretty” quotes of the appropriate type.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package typopunct

      (typopunct-change-language 'english t))
  #+end_src
